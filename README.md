Agricultural Product Request & Approval System

This project is a full-stack agricultural product request and approval system designed to reflect Ethiopia’s multi-level administrative hierarchy (Kebele → Woreda → Zone → Region → Federal).

Farmers can request agricultural products, and administrators at different levels can approve, reject, or accept requests. The system ensures secure authentication, request tracking, and proper workflow from the grassroots to the federal level.
